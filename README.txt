This is my capstone project, for the imaginary education provider ‘Colmar Academy’.For my colour scheme I chose grey, light grey and orange. This was to keep a professional look, with a burst of vibrancy. I enjoyed this project and the challenges presented. I wanted to make the subject boxes into buttons/links, however when I researched this on the web it said I need to use java, so I didn’t include links for these. I did try to condense my CSS where possible, however this kept causing big errors, so I have kept it organised by section.
